This directory contains a basic latex template for creating a computer
science conference-style paper. The content of the paper is in the
file called paper.tex. The bibliography is in the file called
paper.bib.  The figures that are included in the paper are in the
files with a .png extension.  There is also a Makefile to create a pdf
version of the paper for you.  When you run make, if the tex file or
bib file has changed, then a new pdf version of the paper will be
created.
